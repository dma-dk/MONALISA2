This folder contains a syntax definition for MSDL files.

Apply to your local Text bundle by copying the provided syntax and info.plist into your own text bundle.

If you have any extensions to your textmate2 text bundle, they should be present in this folder.

~/Library/Application\ Support/Avian/Bundles/

If you do, you may have to merge this in. Don't know how.

If you don't have any bundles you can copy this straight into your filesystem and restart textmate2
e.g. 

===
cp -pr Text.tmbundle ~/Library/Application\ Support/Avian/Bundles/
