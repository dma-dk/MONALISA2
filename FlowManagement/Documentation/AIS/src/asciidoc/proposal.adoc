== Introduction
As part of -- and as a contribution to -- the MONA LISA 2.0 <<MONALISA2>> project, the Danish Maritime Authority has worked to define message conversation scenarios and detailed message formats for _flow management_ in the context of _sea traffic management (STM)_ as defined by <<ARCH>>.

The results contain inputs, contributions, and insights from DMA and project partners.

This paper documents the process and the the results, by

. defining the domain problem,
. setting the scope of work,
. establishing design criteria,
. proposing message conversation scenarios,
. defining message formats in different formats,
. validating message formats against design criteria,
. introducing a reference implementation for AIS using application specific messages, and by
. supplying test data to validate correctness.

=== Problem definition

==== Flow management
As defined by <<ARCH>> flow management is communication which takes place between ships in a peer-to-peer situation, or between ships and a coordinating organisation (e.g. VTS, STCC) in order to:

1. Increase safety and prevent delays through a good flow in narrow channels with high traffic density
1. Support vessel in arriving at final destination in due time as efficient as possible
1. Provide information to interested parties about planned and predicted time of arrival to final destination or other point of interest.

For item 1 the term "good" means that collisions and dangerous situations are avoided and that vessels can safely follow their announced tactical voyageplan through the area.

Flow _management_ is based on knowledge of vessels' tactical voyageplans; i.e. announcements from each vessel regarding their intended manouvers in the immediate short-term future. When this knowledge is known either centrally at a coordinating center or distributed between nearby vessels, it is possible for the coordination centre or the nearby vessels to suggest and negotiate tactical voyageplans to obtain a "good" flow. It is this process which is called _flow management_.

If flow management takes place in a self-organizaing manner between vessels on a peer-to-peer basis it is called _autonomous flow management_. When a coordinating center is performing it the process is called _controlled flow management_. In a fully managed scenario -- whether autonomous or controlled -- all vessels can safely and efficiently follow their tactical voyageplans through their entire passage of the area.

===== Tactical voyageplan
In order to facilitate flow management vessels in the area must transmit their tactical voyageplan and optionally basic information concerning their manouvering capabilities.

===== Flow management suggestion
A suggested change to an tactical voyageplan is called a _flow management suggestion_. A flow management suggestion can be transmitted from either a coordination centre or a peer vessel. It can take one of two principal forms:

1. Geometry-based (adding, deleting or changing waypoints)
1. Speed-based (not changing any waypoints)

Changing the geometry of an tactical voyageplan is a relatively complex operation for the vessel's navigator. Among other things the process involves a safety check of the new route and reprogramming of navigational equipment. The cost/workload of this operation reduces the likelihood of a vessel complying with suggested changes.

Changing the vessel's speed (or waypoint ETA's) is a far simpler operation for the navigator. This involves only adjustment of the vessel's speed and recalculation of the wheel-over-point in advance of each waypoint. It is therefore expected, that the likelihood of a of vessel complying with a suggested change of this type is higher than suggested changes to geometry.

==== Controlled flow management
Controlled flow management always takes place inside a defined geographical area called the _controlled area_. The controlled area is a closed polygon.

Vessels can be located inside the controlled area -- or outside the controlled area.

Vessels outside the controlled area can be in state

- _entering_ -- meaning that the vessel intends to enter the controlled area.

Vessels inside the controlled area can be in states

- _leaving_ -- meaning that the vessel intends to leave the controlled area.
- _staying_ -- meaning that the vessel intends to seek berth, drop anchor, or elsehow keep manouvering inside the area.

Some of the vessels are aware of some of the other vessels' tactical voyageplans, and the coordination centre is aware of some of the vessel's tactical voyageplans.

The coordination centre is continuously receiving an AIS data stream, including type 1-3 position messages and type 5 ship and static voyage messages, so that it can maintain an updated real-time picture of the current traffic situation.

==== Autonomous flow management
...

=== Scope of work
The scope of the work in this paper is _controlled flow management in a limited area (in order of size as a VTS area) based on flow management suggestions in the speed-based form_.

The objective is to define _which_ information (i.e. payload, data fields) that need to be exchanged and to define the criteria/triggers for _when_ this information is transmitted.

The outcome is a set of message definitions, transmission criteria, test data, and a reference implementation to support controlled and autonomous flow management.

== Design criteria
Messaging in the maritime domain has been available many years and communication standards have evolved and been added and augmented several times to accomodate the increasing demand for handling more and more complex scenarios in the maritime domain.

When suggesting message exchange for advanced use cases, such as for flow management, we want to take lessons learned from the past years into account. Literature, has as <<TOILS>>, has therefore been studied to establish a set of design criteria for the messages that are defined for flow management.

In section <<design_validation>> it will be validated, that the suggested messages layouts and payloads are in compliance with these design criteria.

=== General design criteria

==== Design with the end-user in mind
In accordance with <<ARCH>>, §3, all systems shall be designed with the end user (e.g. mariner, ship owner, operator), in mind.

====
This shall be achieved, by carefully identifying and defining use cases expressed in user domain terms and approved by user domain experts (such as navigators) before the actual design of message conversations and message layouts takes place. And by validating that the detailed message designs support the defined use cases.
====

==== Design for multivendor environment
In accordance with <<ARCH>>, §3 p.6, one of the main goals (here interpreted as _design criteria_) of the MONALISA 2.0 project is to "achieve full and seamless interoperability of systems in Sea Traffic Management (STM) [...] in a multi-vendor environment".

====
This shall be achieved by ensuring that relevant stakeholders in government and industry can contribute to and review the design of conversations and messages in flow management.
====

==== Information transfer involving ships must be bandwidth efficient
In accordance with <<ARCH>>, §7 p.23, information transfer involving ships must be highly bandwidth efficient.

====
This shall be achieved by designing messages to be as compact as possible, avoiding redundant information in message layouts, and using bit-level compression where applicable and possible.
====

==== Ship-shore interactions must be robust
In accordance with <<ARCH>>, §7 p.23, ship-shore interactions must be robust to unstable, changing, high latency links.

====
This shall be achieved by ???
====

==== Ship-shore data IP connections must be initiated from ship
In accordance with <<ARCH>>, §7 p.23, ship-shore data connections must be initiated from ship, to address cyber security.

====
This shall be achieved by designing the required mechanisms of communication, such that ship-to-shore communication is based on IP-based connection-oriented communication (e.g. TCP/IP), then such a connection can only be initiated from the ship-side.
====

=== AIS-specific design criteria

==== Consider updated definitions of ASM and related guidance, before developing new ASM;
In accordance with <<IALA144>>, recommendation 4, IALA recommends that members make use of the IALA ASM collection <<AISASM>> by taking into account other updated definitions of ASM and related guidance, before developing new or implementing the use of existing Regional ASM.

====
This shall be achieved by consulting the ASM collection <<AISASM>> to ensure that no other existing ASM already fulfills the requirements of any newly designed message before it is submitted for approval.
====

==== Contribute to the IALA AIS ASM collection
In accordance with <<IALA144>>, recommendation 6, members are recommended to contribute to the IALA ASM collection through their National IALA Member.

====
This shall be achieved by ensuring that the final and agreed ASM messages to support flow management are submitted to the IALA ASM collection by the national IALA member, in this case the Danish Maritime Authority.
====

==== Low transmission frequency
In accordance with <<AISG289>>, §3.3, the frequency of message transmission should be limited in order to prevent system overload.

====
This shall be achieved by careful design of the criteria which trigger a message transmission, in order to minimise the number of transmissions to the lowest possible.
====

==== Limit no. of VHF transmission slots
In accordance with <<AISG289>>, §3.4, AIS messages occupying more than three (3) slots should be avoided, unless there is a low load on the VDL or a compelling reason to do so.

====
This shall be achieved by designing messages to avoid occupying more than 3 slots.
====

==== Use 6-bit ASCII
As pointed out by <<TOILS>> the decision to use 6-bit ASCII encoding in AIS messages is a _blunder_. But as it states: "Some major defects, such as the handling of string data, are too deeply embedded to be removed". Thus in the design of new messages, the 6-bit encoding scheme will be maintained to avoid further complexity to <<AISSPEC5>> and related recommendations and guidelines.

====
This shall be achieved by designing string fields of new messages to use the 6-bit character encoding scheme defined by <<AISSPEC5>> annex 8.
====

==== Fixed length messages
By experience and in accordance with <<TOILS>>, "types 1 through 4: Fixed-length felicity", fixed-length messages are simple to parse and can be regarded as one production in the message _grammar_. <<TOILS>> further states, that "from a reliability-engineering point of view, this [fixed-length messages] is a best case scenario".

====
This shall be achived by designing any new messages, so that they have fixed bit-length and fixed field-offsets, unless there are important and documented reasons why this cannot be achieved.
====

==== Fixed bit-offset for fields
<<TOILS>>, "Ways forward for AIS", recommends to avoid fields with variable offsets.

====
This shall be achieved by designing new ASMs to have fixed bit-length for each data field to ensure that each data fields starts at a fixed bit-offset.
====

==== Variable fields last
According to <<TOILS>>, "Drawing lessons from the defects", it is a minor defect not to have variable-length fields be the last in the message (such as the variable-length binary payload in message type 26 followed by a radio-status field). Variable-length fieds should first and foremost be avoided. And if, for compelling reasons, they cannot - they should be transmitted last in the message to preserve fixed-offset for as many data fields as possible.

====
This shall be achieved by designing new ASMs so that any variable-length data fields are at the end of the message.
====

==== One dispatch field
<<TOILS>> states in several places that the no. of protocol extension mechanisms should be minimal and preferably limited to 1. Any _dispatch fields_ used to control message variants (such as the message type field), should precede any of the data fields it controls.

====
This shall be achieved by designing new ASMs so that no new extension mechanisms are introdued, to use a minimal no. of dispatch fields, and take dispatch fields into use in the following order: Message ID, Application Identifier, Message-specific dispatch.
====

[[minimum_datatypes]]
==== Minimum no. of datatypes
<<TOILS>> states that good practice is "for there to be just one type per natural kind; e.g. in a geolocation protocol all longitudes should be encoded with the same length, signedness, and special values. Ditto all latitudes, bearings, timestamp fields, etc.". This also holds for the encoding of numeric valuesfootnote:[Such as e.g. the "Rate of Turn field in the Common Navigation Block required taking a (sign-preserving) square root and then scaling" - which is different from all other numeric fields.] and the indication of non-existent values in order to avoid complicating exception and variants.

====
This shall be achieved by designing new ASMs so that they do not introduce any unnecessart new data type or encodings, and so that they (re-)use the most common and widely used type encoding used elsewhere in <<AISSPEC5>>.
====

[[single_point_of_truth]]
==== Single point of truth
<<TOILS>> recommends, based on lessons learned from message types 6 and 8, that messages should obey the "single point of truth" principle. This means that there should be no information redundancy inherint in the message, and that one piece of information can only be deduced from a single source in the message.

====
This shall be achieved by designing new ASMs so that no piece of information is redundant with other information in the same message.
====

==== Support stream-based parsers
<<TOILS>> recommends, based on lessons learned from message type 22, that in order to preserve memory and reduce decoder complexity, stream-based decoders must be supported by the message layouts. I.e. decoders which can decode incoming messages without looking ahead in the bit stream.

====
This shall be achieved by designing new ASMs so that any dispatch-field, changing the interpretation of the message, is transmitted _before_ the data fields whose interpretation it influences.
====

==== Don't split data fields across datagrams
As pointed out by <<TOILS>> some AIS messages, such as type 24, need to be reconstructed from two individually transmitted datagrams. This increases decoder complexity by requiring it to hold state between datagrams - and it adds a new dimension to the set of edge cases and problem scenarios, that must be foreseen. Therefore messages split across multiple datagrams must be avoided and all datagrams must be independent.

====
This shall be achieved be designing any new ASMs to that their entire state is communicated in a single datagram.
====

==== Check design using ASN.1
<<TOILS>>, "Drawing lessons from the implementations", recommends "that application-protocol designers should, as a routine part of their process, render the design as a specification in [ASN.1] or [BDEC]."

====
This shall be achieved by supplying ASN.1 notation for each new ASM proposed.
====

==== Provide a reference implementation
<<TOILS>>, "Drawing lessons from the implementations", recommends to "do a reference implementation before you publish an application protocol as a standard" and "as a best practice, the reference implementation should be open source".

====
This shall be achieved by developing an open source reference implementation of a decoder for each proposed ASM. This reference implementation must be able to decode all variants of the ASM and should be developed before the protocol is published as a standard.
====

==== Provide test data sets for all message variants
<<TOILS>>, "Drawing lessons from the implementations", recommends that "an example binary datagram in each of every possible variation of message shape together with a textual, human-readable decode of that datagram" is supplied to enable test and validation of decoders.

====
This shall be achieved by supplying example datagrams together with a human-readable decode of that datagram for each message variant.
====

== Design of flow management message types and conversations

=== High-level design
In the high-level design of support for flow management no assumptions are made about the characteristics of the underlying transport layer. Focus here, is to identify which pieces of information need to be exchanged, between whom, and when. Following this are detailed specifications for mapping this outcome to real-world protocols, such as AIS <<AISSPEC5>>.

The messages to support flow management must have following characteristics:

- The message payload should be related to the current tactical execution, the imminent future. I.e. the message should not be designed for planning purposes or announcement of future intentions.
- The message should have carrying capability for as many waypoints as possible.
- The message should optionally support ETA or SOG per waypoint and vessel's turn radius.

==== Message types
Based on the <<use_cases>> it is noted, that the following messages are involved in flow management:

- *tactical voyageplan broadcast*. For a vessel to broadcast its tactical voyageplans.
- *tactical voyageplan inquiry*. An addressed message transmitted by coordination centers and vessels to inquire a vessel about its tactical voyageplan.
- *flow management suggestion*. An addressed message transmitted by coordination centers and vessels to suggest changes to a vessel's announced tactical voyageplan.

==== Payloads and transmission triggers

The sugested payloads and transmission triggers of these message types are the following.

===== Tactical voyageplan broadcast

[cols="2,2,8"]
.Information payload of message type *tactical voyageplan broadcast*.
|===
| Data field | Type | Description

| Sender | Required | Sender identification
| Activation indicator | Required | Indication of whether the vessel cancels/deactives its voyageplan or whether it actively follows it.
| Waypoints | Required | Positions of waypoints on the tactical voyageplan.
| Active waypoint | Required | Indication of which of the waypoints the vessel is currently navigating towards.
| TCD | Optional | Ship's turning radius in the current area (read more in <<definitions>>).
| ETA active waypoint | Required | Estimated time of arrival at active waypoint.
| ETA last waypoint | Required | Estimated time of arrival at last waypoint.
| ETA other waypoints | Optional | Estimated time of arrival at respective waypoint.
|===

The message must only be transmitted by vessels.

The message is only transmitted if vessel is conned along an active voyageplan. In that case, the following transmission triggers apply:

1. Periodically.footnote:[Using AIS: Every six minutes (due to what is stated in <<AISSPEC5>> (§4.2.1) regarding sending interval for voyage related information]
1. On voyage plan activation.
1. On voyage plan change (change to waypoints or ETA at waypoints).
1. On voyage plan deactivation/cancellation.
1. On change of active waypoint.
1. As reply to message "tactical voyageplan inquiry".

Retransmission is not applicable.

===== Tactical voyageplan inquiry

[cols="2,2,8"]
.Information payload of message type *tactical voyageplan broadcast*.
|===
| Data field | Type | Description

| Receiver | Required | Receiver identification
| Sender | Required | Sender identification

|===

The message can be transmitted by vessels or shore-based coordination centres.

Retransmission is not applicable.

The following transmission triggers apply:

1. On need by control centre to receive tactical voyageplan from a vessel. In case of e.g.:
- Vessel's arrival to controlled area.
- Previously announced tactical voyageplan is invalid (e.g. expired, or vessel's manouvers deviate significantly from it).
- Loss of data in control center.
1. On need by vessel to receive tactical voyageplan from another vessel.
- The inquired vessel's intentions are unknown to the inquirying vessel; e.g. in case of
* Tactical voyageplan was never transmitted by inquired vessel.
* Tactical voyageplan was never received by inquirying vessel.
* Information about another vessel's tactical voyageplan was lost onboard the inquirying vessel (e.g. due to system restart or improper operation).

===== Flow management suggestion

[cols="2,2,8"]
.Information payload of message type *flow management suggestion*.
|===
| Data field | Type | Description

| Sender | Required | Sender identification
| Waypoints | Required | Positions of waypoints on the tactical voyageplan.
| Active waypoint | Required | Indication of which of the waypoints the vessel is currently navigating towards.
| ETA active waypoint | Required | Suggested time of arrival at active waypoint.
| ETA last waypoint | Required | Suggested time of arrival at last waypoint.
| ETA other waypoints | Optional | Suggested time of arrival at respective waypoint.
|===

The message must only be transmitted by shore-based coordination centres. It can only be addressed to vessels following an active tactical voyageplan announced via the tactical voyageplan broadcast message.

Retransmission is not applicable.

The following transmission triggers apply:

1. On need to suggest changes to tactical voyageplan to support flow management. E.g. if a coordination center determines, that better overall flow can be achieved by the receiving vessel:
- changing ETA to announced waypoints.

==== Use case scenarios

Vessel A arrives at area.

It has routinely broadcast message "tactical voyageplan" or "tactical voyageplan, extended"
If not: The control center sends message "tactical voyageplan, inquiry"

====== Review of ASM DAC=001; FI=27 - "Route information"

Review of the application specific message DAC=001; FI=27 defined by <<ASM_001_27>> in the context of flow management yields the following comments:

1. <<ASM_001_27>> specifies that "_13.1 This message ... should only be used in when important route information ... – not already provided by current official nautical charts or publications – needs to be relayed by authorities or vessels_". +
+
It is unclear whether a tactical voyageplan (in MONALISA terms) is "important route information". Certainly tactical voyageplans are not normally on any charts or publications; but are they "important" in the context of this message type?
1. <<ASM_001_27>> specifies that "_13.4 In order to allow advance notice, this message should be transmitted prior to the start date and time specified for the routing information. It should not be transmitted more than one day in advance_". +
+
The statement that the message should not "should not be transmitted more than one day in advance" indicates that this message is for planning purposes, and not related to the imminent tactical situation.
1. In the message layout <<ASM_001_27>> there is a field called "sender classification" which can only take one legal value: "1 = authority". Values 2-7 are reserved for future use. The value 0 is not defined in the specification, but since §13.1 indicates that the message can be used by vessels, perhaps 0 means that the sender is a vessel. But this is unclear.
1. The data field "duration" occupies 18 bits and thus supports a max. value of 262142 minutes (using 262143 to indicate value not available) <<ASM_001_27>>. 262142 minutes equals 4.369 hours or 182 days. This is far beyong the needs for a tactical voyageplan and is therefore not efficient bit-usage for this purpose.
1. In <<ASM_001_27>> the data field "number of waypoints" is redundant with message length and thus violates the design criteria <<single_point_of_truth>>. Since the specification states that "The number of waypoints is determined by the length of the message." the presence of this field is a mystery. 5 bits could be saved.
1. The message does not support individual ETA or turn radius per waypoint or SOG between waypoints.

In conclusion, DAC=001; FI=27 has an unclear specification, inefficient bit usage, and appears to be intended for planning purposes rather than the imminent tactical situation.

Therefore DAC=001; FI=27 is not suitable or recommmended for use in flow management.

====== Review of ASM DAC=219; FI=01 - "Intended route"

Review of the application specific message DAC=219; FI=01 defined by <<ASM_219_01>> in the context of flow management yields the following comments:

1. It is well-defined _when_ this message must be sent.
1. First waypoint is always active waypoint - thus the message only carries future intentions.
1. The data field "ETA active WP" can be set one year ahead. The good thing about this, is that it complies with the <<minimum_datatypes>> design criteria; but the bad thing is that it wastes bits; since the lifespan of a tactical voyageplan can probably be expressed in the order of hundres of minutes correponding to 10 bits of information.
1. In <<ASM_219_01>> the data field "number of waypoints" is redundant with message length and thus violates the design criteria <<single_point_of_truth>>. It is unclear whether message length or data field "number of waypoints" determines the no. of waypoint. In either case, the bits used for the data field "number of waypoints" could be saved.
1. The message does not support individual ETA or turn radius per waypoint or SOG between waypoints.

In conclusion, DAC=219; FI=01 has some of the same discrepancies as DAC=001; FI=27, but the events which trigger transmission are more well-defined, it is clear that this message is transmitted by vessels (not shore stations); and it is clear that this message intended for communicating immediate navigation intentions in the same way as required for tactical voyageplans.

Therefore it is recommended
- to use DAC=219; FI=01 as a means for vessels to broadcast their tactical voyageplans flow management.
- to suggest one new message, with the same purpose as DAC=219; FI=01, but with the extended capability of expressing individual ETA and turn radius per waypoint.

====== Review of ASM DAC=219; FI=02 - "Route suggestion"
Review of the application specific message DAC=219; FI=01 defined by <<ASM_219_01>> in the context of flow management yields the following comments:

1. The purpose of this message is to suggest a new route _geometry_.
1. The message does not support individual ETA or turn radius per waypoint or SOG between waypoints.
1. The data field "ETA active WP" can be set one year ahead. The good thing about this, is that it complies with the <<minimum_datatypes>> design criteria; but the bad thing is that it wastes bits; since the lifespan of a tactical voyageplan can probably be expressed in the order of hundres of minutes correponding to 10 bits of information.
1. In <<ASM_219_01>> the data field "number of waypoints" is redundant with message length and thus violates the design criteria <<single_point_of_truth>>. It is unclear whether message length or data field "number of waypoints" determines the no. of waypoint. In either case, the bits used for the data field "number of waypoints" could be saved.

In conclusion, DAC=219; FI=02 has some of the same discrepancies as DAC=001; FI=27. It is clear that this message intended for communicating suggestions of route geometry - not speed-based flow management.

Therefore DAC=219; FI=02 is not suitable or recommmended for use in flow management.

== AIS message definitions

The following AIS message definitions are proposed for flow management support.

=== Tactical voyageplan broadcast
Formally proposed specification copied from <<ASM_219_01>>.

====

This message allows the communication of a vessels intended route to other vessels and shore stations.

The rules for broadcasting this message are the following

a. Only broadcast when the vessel is following an activated route.
a. The route must be broadcast every six minutes, due to what is stated in ITU-R M.1371-4 (§4.2.1) regarding sending interval for voyage related information.
a. On route activation the route must be broadcast.
a. When active waypoint changes the route must be broadcast.
a. On route deactivation, or when a route is completed, an empty message with no waypoints must be sent to indicate that the vessel is not following an intended route.

The broadcast waypoints must start with the current active waypoint and include up to the 15 following waypoints, giving a maximum of 16 waypoints.

Broadcasting 16 waypoints will result in a 5-slot message. It is recommended to avoid messages with more than 3 slots, equivalent to no more than 8 waypoints.

=== Tactical voyageplan inquiry
Proposal:

====

*Transmitter* +
Vessels and coordination centres.

*Transmission triggering events* +
The following events should trigger transmission:

1. On need by control centre to receive tactical voyageplan from a vessel. In case of e.g.:
- A vessel's arrival to controlled area.
- A vessel's previously announced tactical voyageplan is considered invalid by the inquirer, e.g. because
* the timestamp of the active waypoint is in the past.
* the vessel's manouvers deviate significantly from its announced tactical voyageplan.
- Loss of data in control center.
1. On need by vessel to receive tactical voyageplan from another vessel.
- The inquired vessel's intentions are unknown to the inquirying vessel; e.g. in case of
* Tactical voyageplan was never transmitted by inquired vessel.
* Tactical voyageplan was never received by inquirying vessel.
* Information about another vessel's tactical voyageplan was lost onboard the inquirying vessel (e.g. due to system restart or improper operation).

*Retransmission* +
Except in the sense of missing protocol acknowledgement as per <<AISSPEC5>>, Annex 8 §3.5 -- retransmission is not applicable.

=== Flow management suggestion

This message contains lat/longs - can later be used for route change suggestions.

Proposal:

====

*Transmitter* +
Coordination centers (for controlled flow management).

*Transmission prerequisites* +
The message is only transmitted if the receiving vessel has previously broadcast a tactical voyage plan which is still considered valid by the control center (e.g. ETA of active waypoint is in the future).

This message can only be sent in response to a "Tactical voyageplan broadcast" or a "Tactical voyageplan broadcast, extended".

The latitude and longitude of suggested active and planned waypoints must match exactly those received in the latest "Tactical voyageplan broadcast" or a "Tactical voyageplan broadcast, extended". If this is not the case, the vessel, to which the flow management suggestion is addressed, must disregard it, and broadcast a new tactical voyageplan message.

If the flow management suggestion is sent in response to a "Tactical voyageplan broadcast" containing 15 or 16 waypoints, only the first 14 need to be included.

*Transmission triggering events* +
The following events must trigger a transmission of this message:

1. On coordination center determining that speed-based changes to tactical voyageplan of vessel will lead to a better overall flow.

*Retransmission* +
Retransmission is not applicable.

*Message format*
Waypoints are denoted WP~_0_~, WP~_1_~, WP~_i_~,..., WP~_n_~ and are navigated in sequence. WP~_0_~ is the _suggested active waypoint_ currently to be steered towards. WP~_i_~, where _i_ ≥ 1, is called the _following suggested waypoints_.

|Term |Definition

|Strategic voyageplan | MONALISA 2 term for long term planning that consists of a route with a voyage number (and other Route information), a list of waypoints (geometry), a schedule, charter parties, legal conditions, and more. When a Strategic voyage plan is given to the ship as a voyage order it changes to _dynamic voyageplan_.
|Dynamic voyageplan | MONALISA 2 term for an optimised version of the _strategic voyageplan_
|Tactical voyageplan | MONALISA 3 term for a dynamic voyageplan in conning mode; i.e. under tactical execution. Whole or parts of the tactical voyage plan can be transmitted to increase situational awareness and support flow management.
|Turning circle diameter | Merchant ships usually turn in a circle having a diameter of about 3–4 times the length between perpendiculars. TCD varies little with speed, but can vary significantly between manouvers in deep and shallow waters. TCD depends on the size and geometry of a vessel, the size of its rudder, and the no. and characteristics of propellers. Cf. <<SBTCD>> for more.
