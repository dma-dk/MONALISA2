== Introduction
As part of -- and as a contribution to -- the MONA LISA 2.0 <<MONALISA2>> project, the Danish Maritime Authority has worked to define message conversation scenarios and detailed message formats for _flow management_ in the context of _sea traffic management (STM)_ as defined by <<ARCH>>.

The results contain inputs, contributions, and insights from DMA and project partners.

This paper documents the process and the results, by

. defining the domain problem,
. establishing a set of use cases for the domain,
. defining message formats for use case interaction,
. introducing a reference implementation, and by 
. supplying test data to validate its correctness.

=== Problem definition

==== Flow management
As defined by <<ARCH>> flow management is communication which takes place between ships in a peer-to-peer situation, or between ships and a coordinating organisation (e.g. VTS, STCC) in order to:

1. Increase safety and prevent delays through a good flow in narrow channels with high traffic density
2. Support vessel in arriving at final destination in due time as efficient as possible
3. Provide information to interested parties about planned and predicted time of arrival to final destination or other point of interest.

For item 1 the term "good" means that collisions and dangerous situations are avoided and that vessels can safely follow their announced tactical voyage plan through the area.

Flow _management_ is based on knowledge of vessels' tactical voyage plans; i.e. announcements from each vessel regarding their intended manouvers in the immediate short-term future. When this knowledge is known either centrally at a coordinating center or distributed between nearby vessels, it is possible for the coordination centre or the nearby vessels to suggest and negotiate tactical voyage plans to obtain a "good" flow. It is this process which is called _flow management_.

If flow management takes place in a self-organizaing manner between vessels on a peer-to-peer basis it is called _autonomous flow management_. When a coordinating center is performing flow management the process is called _controlled flow management_. In a fully managed scenario -- whether autonomous or controlled -- all vessels can safely and efficiently follow their tactical voyage plans through their entire passage of the area.

===== Intension and Tactical Voyage Plan
In order to facilitate flow management vessels participate by providing intentions as well as tactical voyage plans. A tactical voyage plan is a subset of the Dynamic Voyage Plan and contains the immediate upcoming waypoints and their schedule.

===== Flow Management Suggestion
A suggested change to a tactical voyage plan is called a _flow management suggestion_. A flow management suggestion can be transmitted from either a coordination centre or a peer vessel. It can take one of two principal forms:

1. Geometry-based (adding, deleting or changing waypoints)
2. Speed-based (not changing any waypoints)

Changing the geometry of a tactical voyage plan is a relatively complex operation for the vessels navigator. Among other things the process involves a safety check of the new route and re-programming of navigational equipment. The cost/workload of this operation reduces the likelihood of a vessel complying with suggested changes.

Changing the vessels speed (or waypoint ETA's) is a far simpler operation for the navigator. This involves only adjustment of the vessels speed and recalculation of the wheel-over-point in advance of each waypoint. It is therefore expected, that the likelihood of a of vessel complying with a suggested change of this type is higher than suggested changes to geometry.

==== Controlled flow management
Controlled flow management always takes place inside a defined geographical area called the _controlled area_. The controlled area is a closed polygon.

Vessels can be located inside the controlled area -- or outside the controlled area.

Vessels outside the controlled area can be in state

- _entering_ -- meaning that the vessel intends to enter the controlled area.

Vessels inside the controlled area can be in states

- _leaving_ -- meaning that the vessel intends to leave the controlled area.
- _staying_ -- meaning that the vessel intends to seek berth, drop anchor, or elsehow keep manouvering inside the area.

Some of the vessels are aware of some of the other vessels tactical voyage plans, and the coordination centre is aware of some of the vessels tactical voyage plans.

As part of [[ARCH]] vessels are required to publish their Dynamic Voyage Plan to STCC when it has been changed and safety checked.

The coordination centre is continuously receiving an AIS data stream, including type 1-3 position messages and type 5 ship and static voyage messages, so that it can maintain an updated real-time picture of the current traffic situation.

==== Autonomous flow management
...

==== Maritime Cloud

The Maritime Cloud [[MARCLOUD]] is defined as “A communication framework enabling efficient, secure, reliable and seamless electronic information exchange 
between all authorized maritime stakeholders across available communication systems” and contains

. A Maritime Identify Registry
. A Maritime Service Portfolio Registry
. A Maritime Messaging Service (MMS)

[[img-mar-cloud]]
.The Maritime Cloud enable vessels and stakeholders to provide services in a secure exchange
image::images/maritimecloud.png[img-mar-cloud, align="center"]

Vessels, STCC and other stakeholders may enable a service by providing an _endpoint_ which can be queried. Requests may be initiated from any stakeholder by invocation of the _endpoint_.

Vessels, STCC and other stakeholders may also choose to _broadcast_ a set of messages. Messages may be geo-located to a specific area.

Service endpoints and broadcast messages are described in a specific Maritime Service Descriptor Language (MSDL).



=== Scope of work
The scope of the work in this paper is _controlled flow management in a limited area (in order of size as a VTS area) based on flow management suggestions using maritime cloud services_.

The objective is to define _which_ information (i.e. messages) that need to be exchanged and to define the criteria/triggers for _when_ this information is transmitted.

The outcome is a set of message definitions, endpoints, test data, and a reference implementation to support controlled flow management.

== Use cases

=== Use cases for controlled flow management

==== Use case: Vessel approaches the controlled area

{set:step:0}
[cols="1,5"]
.Use case.
|===
| {counter:step} | The coordination centre detects that a vessel approaches or has already entered the controlled area.
| {counter:step} | The coordination centre request the intension from the vessel with regards to the controlled area.
| {counter:step} | The vessel responds with a status indicating its intension.
| {counter:step} | The coordination centre may choose to include or exclude the vessel for flow management.
| *Exception*    | Requestor may not be a coordination centre.

| {counter:step} | The vessel responds with a tactical voyage plan.
| *Exception*    | Requestor may not be a coordination centre or nearby vessel.

|Term |Definition

|Strategic voyage plan | MONALISA 2 term for long term planning that consists of a route with a voyage number (and other Route information), a list of waypoints (geometry), a schedule, charter parties, legal conditions, and more. When a Strategic voyage plan is given to the ship as a voyage order it changes to _dynamic voyage plan_.
|Dynamic voyage plan | MONALISA 2 term for an optimised version of the _strategic voyage plan_
|Tactical voyage plan | MONALISA 3 term for a dynamic voyage plan in conning mode; i.e. under tactical execution. Whole or parts of the tactical voyage plan can be transmitted to increase situational awareness and support flow management.
