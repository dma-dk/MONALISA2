== Introduction
As part of and as a contribution to the MONA LISA 2.0 <<MONALISA2>> project the Danish Maritime Authority has worked to define message conversation scenarios and detailed message formats for _flow management_ in the context of _sea traffic management (STM)_ <<ARCH>>.

This paper documents the process and the the results, by
. defining the domain problem,
. establishing design criteria,
. proposing message conversation scenarios,
. defining message formats in different formats,
. introducing a reference implementation for AIS using application specific messages, and by
. supplying test data to validate its correctness.

== Design criteria
Since the 1990's, when AIS was first incepted, a large amount of work in the field maritime messaging has been performed. In order take advantage of lessons learned and other previous experiences, a number of design criteria for the current work have been defined. The proposed design and reference implementation on flow management support complies with each of these criteria. This will be validated in <<design_validation>>.

=== Use case 2:

== Design of flow management support

=== High-level design
In the high-level design of support for flow management no assumptions are made about the characteristics of the underlying transport layer. Focus here, is to identify which pieces of information need to be exchanged, between whom, and when. Following this are detailed specifications for mapping this outcome to real-world protocols, such as AIS <<AISSPEC5>>.
